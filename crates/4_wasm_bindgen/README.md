# Rust+C in the same WASM binary

## Project 4: Wasm-Bindgen

Building on top of the previous example, what if we want a more idiomatic interface in our Javascript?

The canonical way of doing that in the Rust world is by using [Wasm Bindgen](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen). While one could wrap the exported methods manually with a custom JS class, Wasm Bindgen and Wasm Pack make this process extremely convenient and safe.

For spicing things up a little bit, we'll move the whole Calculator definition entirely to C.

## The Calculator class

This project has the same functions as the last one, but wrapped in a Javascript class generated by Wasm Bindgen:

- `Calculator.add()`
- `Calculator.subtract()`
- `Calculator.multiply()`
- `Calculator.divide()`
- `Calculator.store()`
- `Calculator.retrieve()`
- `Calculator.clear()`
